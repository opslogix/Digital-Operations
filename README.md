# Overview
## OpsLogix Digital Operations Framework includes everything from installing and configuring a successful monitoring platform to documentation, naming conventions, supportive processes, and best practices alerting thresholds of most technologies.

## A ready-to-use monitoring solution built for the future.

The Digital Operations Taxonomy™ management pack helps organizations classify their devices by adding extended properties to the monitoring objects in the Operations database. The properties are populated by running a SCOM Task, via bulk import through PowerShell or a CMDB Sync. 

Based on the monitoring level, the objects get dynamically included in corresponding classification groups, which could be used as targets for various overrides. Other classification properties – like Business Unit, Operated By, Site, etc. – can be used for automated alert routing in enterprise ticketing systems.

## Digital Operations Framework also includes:

Best-practices and ready-to-use Override Management Packs configured to support different levels of monitoring supported by the taxonomy extension.
Script library for operational activities such as creating Management Packs, Distributed Applications, and Groups.
Autonomous Windows Service Monitoring
Autonomous Maintenance Mode Management
Compliance & Governance Monitoring
Library of Custom Application Management Packs
Tools for documentation and change management automation
Process support documents and naming conventions.
